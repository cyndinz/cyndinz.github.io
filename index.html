      <h2>Gaafree</h2>
      <p>Gaafree has no concrete definition - at least, not yet. It’s something that has lingered in my mind for quite some time, a concept shaped by the enchantment of the magical universe and the brilliance of science. I truly believe there should be a portal where we can come together to explore and connect over all these incredible ideas.</p>

      <h2>Unitarity</h2>
      <p>The principle of unitarity says that information about a system’s initial state is preserved in its final state. Even if it transforms wildl via entropy or black holes, it's still encoded in the system somehow.<br> 
        Stephen Hawking initially proposed that Hawking radiation doesn't carry information thus information could be lost in black holes. <br>
        Later theory holographic principle invented by Gerard 't Hooft, developed and formalized by Leonard Susskind, and mathematically backed by Juan Maldacena suggests that information isn't lost but somehow smeared on the event horizon or encoded in the Hawking radiation. <br> 
        Hence, my question: information can be radiated out? Recoverable? Reversible?</p>

      <h2>Waltz</h2>
      <p>The stars are dancing, bright and free, a waltz of fire in endless sea. <br> They spin and shimmer, burn and gleam, a silent song, a golden dream. <br> The planets turn in measured flight, bound by forces, locked in light. <br> Yet in their glow, a truth we find - we're but a spark in space and time.</p>

      <h2>Infinity</h2>
      <p>No edge, no end, no final line, a silent stretch beyond the time. <br> The stars dissolve, yet still they glow, in endless paths we’ll never know. <br> A breath, a pulse, a ceaseless stream, forevermore, a boundless dream. <br> For all we are and all we'll be, is but a wave upon the infinity.</p>
